# TSNE

(t-SNE) t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding is a non-linear dimensionality reduction
algorithm used for exploring high-dimensional data. It maps multi-dimensional data to two 
or more dimensions suitable for human observation. With help of the t-SNE algorithms, you may have 
to plot fewer exploratory data analysis plots next time you work with high dimensional data. 

## Dimension Reductionality

Well, in simple terms, dimensionality reduction is the technique of representing multi-dimensional
data (data with multiple features having a correlation with each other) in 2 or 3 dimensions.
Some of you might question why do we need Dimensionality Reduction when we can plot the data using
scatter plots, histograms & boxplots and make sense of the pattern in data using descriptive statistics. 

## What does t-SNE actually do ?

Itâ€™s quite simple actually, t-SNE a non-linear dimensionality reduction algorithm finds
patterns in the data by identifying observed clusters based on similarity of data points 
with multiple features. But it is not a clustering algorithm it is a dimensionality 
reduction algorithm. This is because it maps the multi-dimensional data to a lower 
dimensional space, the input features are no longer identifiable.
 Thus, you cannot make any inference based only on the output of t-SNE.
